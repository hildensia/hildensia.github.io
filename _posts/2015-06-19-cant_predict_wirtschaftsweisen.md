Tomorrow it'll be about 19°C and partly cloudy - at least that's what the
weather forecast tells me. I will be about 75 years old, when I die, and this
year we are supposed to have 2.77 million unemployed in Germany (about 130000
less then last year). Predictions about our future are everywhere. It is the
single reason for research in physics: To create models that predict how systems
will behave. We are so used to these forecasts and predictions that we hardly
ever question them. I started to be more doubtful about them when I first read
[The Black Swan](http://www.amazon.de/Black-Swan-Impact-Improbable-Incerto/dp/081297381X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434443002&sr=8-1&keywords=the+black+swan+nassim+taleb) by [Nassim
Taleb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Taleb). He told me that humans are
quite bad at predicting anything that does not follow linear models and
normal distributions and that in fact virtually every important part of our life
falls in that category. But on the other hand you shouldn't believe what you
read and so I decided to find out myself if Nassim Taleb's raid on statistics is
reasonable or not. _Can't Predict?_ is a series about
(scientific) predictions, which have caught the attention of a wider audience. I will try to test
whether they are correct and to what extent. This first episode is about the
_Wirtschaftsweisen_...

Every year, shortly before Santa brings us presents, there is a group of old
men in Germany predicting the future. They are called the _Wirtschaftsweisen_,
the wise men of economics. When I was young and their future telling was
announced in television, I always thought of them as some kind of old, bearded
wise men of the orient, bringing gold and myrrh to little Jesus. As it turns out
they are not [particularly old, not at all bearded and not even all
men](http://www.sachverstaendigenrat-wirtschaft.de/ratsmitglieder.html) (though
80% are).  

Their official name is _Sachverständigenrat Wirtschaft_, and they (and their
scientific staff) predict a particular subset of the future: the economic
development of Germany. In 1964 this advisory board of economics (sadly, the translated name isn't nearly as exciting) was established to write a report every year,
and to make informed predictions about the German economy, and to a lesser extent, the rest of the world. The report is intended to help politicians make their
decisions based on scientific reasoning. Thus it is state funded and independent
(as far as this is possible).  Also, as state funded research, [their reports
are available
online](http://www.sachverstaendigenrat-wirtschaft.de/fruehere_jahresgutachten.html)
for free. It is very interesting to skim through these reports for various
reasons. First, it is fun to see how the design evolves. From the nice and clear
60ies typefaces, to the more states-men like serif fonts of the 80ies, to
something which horribly resembles a late 90ies Word document in the year 2000. I wonder
if [Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant) played a significant
role in the design process. Luckily, it looks better these days.

But that's of course not the most interesting part. What was very
intriguing for me was the fact that in the beginning, the focus is more on broad
developments, told by words. No single number was deemed overly important, but together, they pointed in a certain direction. Of course, some numbers where more important than
others, especially the growth of the [gross national
product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_product)
(_Bruttosozialprodukt_), which is the number that predicts the wealth of the nation.
In the 1990ies that changed to the growth of the [gross domestic
product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)
(_Bruttoinlandsprodukt_). However, you had to search for that number in huge
tables. In the late 90ies they started to print that number in bold. And in recent
editions that number can already be found in the preface. It seems like our whole
wealth is reduced to that one dimensional number.

As this number is now the superstar of economic key numbers I will test how
well the wise men do in predicting that number. If you are interested in the
analysis I made, have a look at the [code](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hildensia/hildensia.github.io/blob/master/data/cant_predict/Can%27t%20Predict%3F%20The%20Wirtschaftsweise.ipynb).

First, we have to understand what data we have. The gross domestic product is the
sum of the value of all goods (read services plus things) produced within one
country within one year. Even measuring such a number is not an easy task, let
alone predicting it. The World Bank as well as the statistical agency of Germany
provides us with annual measurements of the GDP since 1970. Let us believe in
these measurements for now. One particular difficulty is that we measure the
GDP in terms of money, but the value of money changes over time (loosely
speaking this is called inflation if it looses value, and deflation if it gains).
So if we look at the absolute GDP numbers, they are not directly comparable
between years.  Thus both prediction as well as growth rates are provided in an
inflation-adjusted manner. To regain absolute values we have to use a curve
called GDP deflator.

If we compute the absolute values from the growth values, we have to multiply by
the deflator to get meaningful numbers. The base year for that deflator is 2005,
which means that the nominal GDP (the number you read in the newspaper) and the
real value (the inflation adjusted) are the same for that year. For all other
years we would compute the values in prices of 2005. If we adjust by the GDP
deflator we gain back the prices of each year, which lets us compare the
predictions to the actual values of each year.

For a sanity check, I first adjusted the measured growth rate provided by the world
bank with the GDP deflator and checked if it matches the absolute GDP values
provided by the statistical agency.

Well, they basically match, up to some rounding errors introduced by the fact
that only two digit precision is provided both by the World Bank and the
statistical agency. But our method seems to work. If we compute the mean error
it is about 1%, which is okay. Now we compare the predicted
growth with the actual growth.

 <iframe src="/data/cant_predict/prediction.html" scrolling="no" onload='javascript:resizeIframe(this);'></iframe>

At first glance that also looks okay, but let's compare it with the
simplest method we can imagine: the the current growth of the GND, as a prediction for next year. A prediction from the Wirtschaftsweisen that is worth anything should at least beat that. Using this strategry, every child
could predict the current announced GND growth for the next year. We will also test 
a different strategy that uses a bit more information: the mean growth so far as growth prediction for the next year, i.e.
we predict for 1986 the mean GND growth using information from  1970 to 1985.

 <iframe src="/data/cant_predict/all_abs.html" scrolling="no" onload='javascript:resizeIframe(this);'></iframe>

The first test (the easy guess) looks even better, don't you think? Okay, we definitely need some
measures to scientifically compare. But simply using the error or squared error
between the curves gives the wrong impression, because the Wirtschaftsweisen adjust
their prediction every year, whereas here I developed the curve from 2005 and
made no readjustment. That way the prediction seems less reliable than it really
is. So I use the actual GND of each year as a base and compute
the absolute prediction. From that I measure the error. The error for all
prediction methods is

 * Easy guess error:  40.07 billion EUR
 * Mean growth error: 32.06 billion EUR
 * Prediction error:  38.50 billion EUR

Wait. The mean growth error is the smallest? And all the errors are not
statistically significantly different?! That means, if I simply assume the
current growth rate for the next year I'm within the range of the
Wirtschaftsweisen. If I assume the mean growth rate so far I'm probably better!
But that's not the whole story. Let's look further into the numbers. Let's look
at the predicted growth.

 <iframe src="/data/cant_predict/growth.html" scrolling="no" onload='javascript:resizeIframe(this);'></iframe>


This is somewhat hard to read, but let's try (also use the zoom and move
function to get a better overview). First, what we see is that the mean growth
stays somewhat stable around 2%. But that's not at all what the real growth rate
looks like. That one is going up and down. So the mean growth rate might make a
smaller error but it is really bad at seeing trends.  The easy guess also goes
up and down, but always one year later. But the changes are not that long term.
It often misses important changes (e.g. see the crisis around 2008). The
prediction, on the other hand, often follows the trend, but misses the right
number. We can also get numbers from that. In statistics we use a measure called
[(Pearson)
correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient)
to see how closely related events from two different random variables are. If
they are just a linear function of the other it is 1 or -1 (then the one
variable goes up, where the other goes down).  If they are not related
whatsoever, the correlation is 0. Lets see how these things are correlated to
the actual growth rate. The Pearson correlation is computed as (if you don't
understand that, simply ignore the math)


$$ \mathrm{Kor}_e (x,y) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y) }{ \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)^2\cdot \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar y)^2 } } $$

where $\bar x$ and $\bar y$ are the mean values.

If we compute this value for all prediction variants we get:

* Correlation prediction/growth:  0.61
* Correlation easy guess/growth:  0.17
* Correlation mean growth/growth: 0.42

So what we have learned from this is that the Wirtschaftsweisen aren't stupid.
They do a good job of analyzing the current situation, they are just not that good at
predicting the absolute value of the growth. But that comes as no surprise. Many factors
play a role in the value you see at the end of the year, lots of the factors are not even
objective and all are highly coupled and non linear. But the Wirtschaftsweisen seem to understand bigger
things. For example all recessions in Germany followed certain important events:

 * the [first oil crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis)
 * the [Iran-Iraq war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War)/second oil crisis
 * the [gulf war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf war) and the [fall of the wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Wende) and [the iron curtain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989)
 * [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks)
 * the [global financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308)

(I hope I'm not reading too much into this.)

No easy guess or mean model would have shown these events. And though the
scientists highly underestimated the results of these events, their trend
prognosis was basically correct. So we should stop looking at the growth rate
prediction and start reading their whole report, which gives us much more
information. Maybe they should also stop giving this number so much weight
their report. They even started to give a higher precision number recently.
While in the past they only had 0.5% steps, now they give a one-decimal
number (e.g. 1.6%), without any scientific reason to believe that this precision
is of any worth. What would also be interesting is if they reported the uncertainty they have over
their predictions. I didn't find it somewhere in the report, but I might have
missed it.

Finally another good question is, if the GND is actually predictive for anything
important (e.g. how satisfied people are with their situation) or if it just
measures the income situation of a nation.
Maybe the [Happy Planet Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy Planet Index)
is a better tool...
But unfortunately this is out of scope of this blog post.
