title: Another blog...
---

There are many blogs out there. On [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/activity/posting/) there are somewhat between 40 and 50 million posts per month. So,
I'll add to that (or not precisely to that number, I'm not at wordpress...). I
hope to write something once a week. 

My topic will be machine learning, ai, code and so forth. I'm a Ph.D. student at
[Uni Stuttgart](http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/) doing research on
machine learning methods in the broad area of robotics, so I often stumble upon
interesting things. Those might be interesting algorithms, misconceptions of a
broader audience to what ai can solve or simply the lack of proper definitions
of terms we use both inside and outside our research community. I try not to
overwhelm the reader with to much math. A bit of here and there might be
necessary though to give you a proper understanding. 

I hope I can find some time to write a little bit interesting stuff. I'll
integrate commenting soon, then feel free to ask. I don't 
like marshmallows, though.
